Final Year student enrolled in an integrated postgraduate programme in Information Technology at [ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/). During the course of my study, I developed a penchant towards the study and research in machine learning and deep learning in Specific. My research interests lie at the crossroads of computer science, mathematics ,and applied sciences. My research objective is to study and delve deeper into the mathematical framework of modern deep learning architectures and machine learning algorithms in general. My ultimate goal is to utilize my knowledge to tackle present-day research problems in Artificial Intelligence domains like Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement learning. I would also like to research and contribute towards the application of AI in the field of computational applied sciences, specifically in Computational Biology and Computational Chemistry. 

I currently work in the Soft Computing laboratory at ABV-IIITM, collaborating with Prof. Anupam Shukla and Dr. Ritu Tiwari, my research lies in understanding the mathematical dynamics of machine learning algorithms and the applicability of nature-inspired algorithms in deep learning architectures for better optimization and scalability. 

My Career objective is to contribute towards the growing AI community in my own small way by getting a Ph.D., learning about the state-of-the-art methodologies prevalent in modern-day cutting-edge research. I would like to pursue a career in academia as a researcher/teacher after earning my doctorate. I perceive that teaching is a noble profession of knowledge dissemination where both the teacher and student benefits and society prospers. I believe that this career choice serves my interests and fulfills my desire. 

Apart from my academic record, I like to read books about topics ranging from medieval history to science fiction. I like to listen to music in my leisure time (People say that I listen to music which is anachronistic, I say that I have an eclectic taste when it comes to music). I also like to travel and savor the local delicacies the place has to offer; this often conflicts with my commitment towards having a healthy lifestyle which motivates me to be active in physical sports and running.

Hello visitor, I would love to hear from you, feel free to drop a mail and we'll connect.
